# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- Cache hits through Studio's OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/ai/{slug}/v1` and
  the unified `/v1` router) failed with a 502 ("unexpected EOF"): a streamed hit
  carried the stored JSON's `Content-Length`, so the gateway wrote an empty body.
  Hits now set `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` for the body actually sent
- An LLM could be served another LLM's cached response (for example an Anthropic
  LLM getting an OpenAI-compatible LLM's JSON for the same model name and
  messages). Entries are now scoped to the LLM, its vendor and the API path
- Gemini requests all shared one entry (the prompt is in `contents`, the model
  in the path). The key now covers the whole request, including `max_tokens`,
  `response_format`, `n`, `top_p`, stop sequences, `tool_choice`, Anthropic tool
  definitions and tool results; only `stream`/`stream_options` are left out
- Streamed tool calls were replayed without their call. Only plain-text,
  single-choice answers are converted between JSON and a stream; anything else
  is replayed in the form it was stored in, or goes upstream
- Gemini (`:streamGenerateContent`) and Ollama (streams by default) streaming
  requests were served JSON. Streaming is now detected per vendor, and vendors
  whose stream the cache cannot produce are never served a cached stream

### Changed
